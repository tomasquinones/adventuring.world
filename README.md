# adventuring.world
This is a personal project aimed at learning how to use different technology stacks like Javascript, Mapbox, (better) CSS, and whatever else is in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.  

Mapbox is going to supply the world map and pull in data from various sources. 

I'd like to pull data from these sources:
FindMeSpot.com
Ridewithgps.com
Strava
RunKeeper
Fitbit
eBird
iNaturalist

There's no timeline or specific goal at this point other than to learn more about web development.
