        <h1 class="about">About the Adventuring.World Project</h1>
        <p>Inspired by Anomalily.World, I wanted to make my own .World domain project to track the interesting places I've been in the world. This would give me a good project to learn how to use a wide variety of technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more on a neat map that I've customized.
        </p>

        <p>This project is far from complete and will be built upon in my spare time and as I learn new front end development techniques.
        </p>

        <p>If you have any questions, comments, recommendations, please feel free to <a href="mailto: hello@adventuring.world">email me</a>!</p>
